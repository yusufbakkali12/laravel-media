✅ **Done!**  
Now copy this file → save it as `README.md` in your package root.

If you want, I can also:
- Generate a `LICENSE` file
- Generate `.gitattributes` & `.gitignore` for your package
- Help add badges (packagist, version, downloads)

Just say:
> “make license and badges”

and I’ll do it! 🚀
